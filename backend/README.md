# kakaw backend

How to run this:

- Navigate to the `kakaw/backend` directory
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Compile the application: `npx tsc`
- Launch the server: `node .`

I set up Prettier for code formatting. You can install [the extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) or for other editors to format code when you save any file, or you can run `npx prettier -w src` to format the entire directory from the command line.
