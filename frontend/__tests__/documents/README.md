# Frontend Testing Suites

## How to Run

The testing suites can be run on the frontend by using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

inside of the frontend folder. If you want to see console output from the code
or the test suites for debugging, you can use `npm run test-verbose` instead.

All testing suites must be put in the corresponding folder in source.
