1. What is not true about a tree with V vertices
- There are always V-1 Edges
- There are no cycles
- Each vertex has at most 2 children
- Removing any edge makes it no longer a tree

2. What library must we include to use Malloc
- <stdio.h>
- <stdlib.c>
- <stdlib.h>
- "stdlib.h"

4. Have you read ben's guide to make
- Yes
- No
- What guide
- Yes but all of it

5. 190 (decimal) is equal to
- 0xBE
- 0x13
- 0x130
- 0276


6. thetime complexity of this for (int i = n; i > 1; i%=2) is
- n^2
- log n
- n
- 1

7. What does strlen("Jess") return?
- any non zero number
- 5
- 4
- This is undefined behavior

8. Which of these is not a bitwise operator
- ^
- |
- ~
- &

9. How can we make C use call by reference?
- Pass in a pointer
- include <stdref.h>
- C is already call by reference
- C can never use call by reference

10. what does sizeof(malloc(10)) return?
- 10
- 8
- Undefined behavior
- sizeof pointer

11. A c array implements the stack ADT
- True
- False

12. the difference between malloc and calloc is
- malloc allocated on the stack, calloc on the heap
- memory allocated by calloc will be freed automatically
- calloc returns memory that has set to zero
- malloc allocates memory, calloc allocates cache

13. What does sizeof("Jess") return?
- any non zero number
- 5
- 4
- This is undefined behavior

14. How big is an int*
- [ ] 1 byte
- [ ] 4 bytes
- [ ] 8 bytes
- [x] sizeof pointer

15. the slowest for most lists is
- quick sort
- shell sort
- merge sort
- insertion sort

16. create an int that can only be used in the file it is defined in
- int x = 10;
- extern int x = 10;
- static int x = 10;
- const int x = 10

17. A file descriptor has type:
- FILE*
- char[]
- int
- Buffer*

18. Why would you use an adjacency list over an adjacency matrix
- it takes less memory
- it has faster random access
- it is faster to change a weight
- it allows the graph to be undirected

19. The & operator 
- gets a reference
- performs logical and
- dereferences 
- is the ternary operator

20. find the length of the array char* x
- strlen(x)
- sizeof(x)
- sizeof(x)/ sizeof(char)
- none of these

21. Which of these sets the nth bit of x to 1
-  x %= n & 1
- x[n] = 1
- x &= (1 << n)
- x |= (1 << n)



22. Which of these is a factor of 0x82EF4009ED7CAC2A5EE12B5F8E8AD9A0AB9CC9F4F3E44B7E8BF2D57A2F2BEACE83424E1CFF0D2A5A7E2E53CB926D61F347DFAA4B35B205B5881CEB40B328E58F

- [x] 0xb709d3a0cd2fec08eafccf540d8a100bb38e5e091d646adb7b14d021096ffcd
